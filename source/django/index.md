    Install and setup Django and use it to create a basic website that has a web app.

    We walk you through the initial steps of getting started with this powerful web framework.  Here we cover installation, virtual environment, creating and modifying the necessary files, and making the necessary configurations for a basic site and app.  We also cover How to use Django's awesome admin interface.

    [Tests](tests/){: class="admonition-title-centered-link"}

    Incorporating automatic tests in your code is always best-practice.

    Django's testing structure makes it easy.  Learn how to write automatic tests for your website backbone to ensure things are working properly and stay that way.

    [Static Files](static/){: class="admonition-title-centered-link"}

    Django primarily focuses on dynamic content.  Here we cover how to cover static files.

    These files might be "static" rather than "dynamic", but they're still important.  These include CSS code for styling, HTML templates, Javascript, images, etc.
