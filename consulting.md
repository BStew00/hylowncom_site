We are a team of two data scientists having a combined work experience of over 30 years, having roles as Senior Mathematical Statistician, in State and Federal agencies and multi-national corporations.  

We have published over 100 manuscripts in scientific peer-reviewed journals as statisticians.  We have consulted on countless projects as data analyst, statistician, data manager, and served roles as subject-matter expert in statistics and data mining.  

We have invented algorithms that outperform the best competition, developed new analytical technologies -- even winning prestigious federal awards for these -- and used a wide-range of statistical and machine learning methods in a professional capacity, including: logistic regression and every parametric/non-parametric statistical method you can imagine; random forests, market basket analysis, and other data mining/machine learning methods; extensive experience with sequential testing, including A/B testing, sentinel surveillance systems...

We are skilled in Python, R, C, SQL, SAS, and others.

If you would like to discuss with us your project in a no-pressure call, please contact us at
